# Frontend Test TEXOIT

This is a NextJS project developed as a application test to TexoIT.
It's a simple frontend screen that shows tables with data called from an API.

It's a simple project, so I decided to make it a little harder than it should by making a reusable table component in the whole application.

## How to run
In dev mode, just execute:
```
npm run dev
```
It will run in your localhost, at the port you decide in package.json or 3000 by default.

## Dependencies used

-NodeJS version 18.17.1, NextJS 13.5.4 and React:^18
